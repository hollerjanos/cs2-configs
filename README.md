# Counter-Strike: 2 - Configurations

## Introduction

- This is my current configurations for Counter-Strike: 2.

## How to clone the repository

- Go inside the following folder:

`Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`

- Run the following commands:

```shell
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:hollerjanos/cs2-configs.git
git pull origin master
```

- This way you are not going to create a folder when cloning the repository.
